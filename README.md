# Pointless-Button
A pointless button written in Ruby with the [Ruby2d](https://www.ruby2d.com) library. 

# Running
As long as you have the `bundler` gem installed, you should be able to just run `bundle install` and then run the code with `ruby main.rb`. If you do not have the `bundler` gem installed and for some reason do not want it, you can also get the dependencies by running `gem install ruby2d`.
